You can contribuite to RED4ext.SDK with issues, ideas and PRs. Simply filling issues or propose new ideas is a great way to contribute.

## Content guidelines

The issue tracker is exclusively for filling and discussing bugs and featurerequests, it is not for scripting support (e.g. `How do I get X handler?`, `How can I call X function?`, etc.). For any other kind of discussion use [discussions](https://github.com/WopsS/RED4ext.SDK/discussions).

### Reporting a bug or requesting a feature

Before filing a bug report or requesting a new features ensure the bug reproduces on the latest version of the library and search existing issues and make sure this issue is not already filed.

## Code guidelines

### Language

The project is using [C++20](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/20), any C++20 features are allowed.

### General

* Use [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) and [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) to style your code before pushing.
* Use names that describe the purpose or intent of the object. Names should be self-explanatory and easily recognizable in the context.
* Minimize the use of abbreviations that would likely be unknown to someone outside of the project.
* Use `auto` whenever it is possible, if the intended type is the correct one (in case of primitive types).
* Brackets (`{}`) must be on new line.

### Namespaces

* Namespaces must be `PascalCase`.
* The code must be in `RED4ext` namespace, even reversed types.

### Classes

* Class names must be `PascalCase`.
* Use `class` and `struct` acordingly.
  * A rule of thumb is to use `struct` for reversed types or objects that carry data, for everything else use `class`.

### Functions

* Function names should be `PascalCase`.

### Variables

* Class data members should be prefixed with `m_`.
* Function arguments should be prefixed with an `a` (**a**rgument).
* Local variables should be `camelCase`.
* Structs data members are named like ordinary variables.

### Enumerators

* Enumerators names must be `PascalCase`.
* Always use `enum class` over `enum`.

### Macros

* Marcos should named with uppercase letters.
* Prefix macros with `RED4EXT_`.
